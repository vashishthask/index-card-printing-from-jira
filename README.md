# index-card-printing-from-jira
If you want to print index cards for your Scrum board from Atlassian Jira, you may use this method.

Index cards can be printed using MS-Word mail-merge functionality with following prerequisites:

* Mail merge template (part of the repo)
* JIRA user-stories, exported in form of excel sheet

Use the instructions mentioned in "Print User-Story Cards with Mail-Merge.pdf" document or in the video https://vimeo.com/232862148/ to create index cards. Print them in a pdf file.

Print the pdf file as 4 or 6 pages in 1 sheet with borders ON. Your index cards are ready.
